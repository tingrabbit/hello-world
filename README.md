I just learn about how to write a online retailers website in https://www.imooc.com/learn/100. 
I think this lesson will teach me about HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
But it don't have JavaScript.And the lesson still use the old way to solve the problems, such as div class="footer" and used too much div. 
Even though the knowledge about the lesson is old, I learn how to start a web layout and cut photos.
The most important thing is I get my first web case!<br>

Lily and I finished a project for a small Web Design Competition.We got a excellence award. It mean we are number 5 or 6 in the rank. This competition make me understand how much knowledge should I learn. I'm unhappy but study harder. On day, I will get such level too.
