# hello-world
I just learn about how to write a online retailers website in https://www.imooc.com/learn/100. 
I think this lesson will teach me about HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
But it don't have JavaScript.
And the lesson still use the old way to solve the problems, such as div class="footer" and used too much div.
Even though the knowledge about the lesson is old, I learn how to start a web layout and cut photos.
The most important thing is I get my first web case!
